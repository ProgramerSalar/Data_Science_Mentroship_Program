# Inheritance Typs
* Single Inheritance
* Multilevel Inheritance
* Hierarchical Inheritance
* Multiple Inheritance(Diamond Problem)
* Hybrid Inheritance

## Inheritance in summary
A class can inherit from another class.

Inheritance improves code reuse

Constructor, attributes, methods get inherited to the child class

The parent has no access to the child class

Private properties of parent are not accessible directly in child class

Child class can override the attributes or methods. This is called method overriding

super() is an inbuilt function which is used to invoke the parent class methods and constructor
